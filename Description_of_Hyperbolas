In the .png file, two hyperbolas are shown. These hyperbolas show the locus of points in which the emitter can possibly be found.
The black hyperbola is the locus found by analyzing receivers "A" and "B." The red hyperbola is the locus found by analyzing receivers
"A" and "C." *A corresponds to (.5,0), B (-.5, 0), and C (0, 1).

When graphed together, these two hyperbola intersect at exactly two points. The upper-left hand intersection (-3.503, 4.004) is correct; 
the other solution (.405, -.273) is erroneous. This can be easily seen by considering that the TDoA of receiver C is 0, while the TDoA's
of receivers A and B are greater than zero. Thus, the emitter must be closer to C than A and B. Only the first solution satisfies this
condition.
